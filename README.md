Description
===========
Use this cookbook to install the Node Agent Daemon (nad) on your system.  Nad acts as an extensible agent to report data back to Circonus.

Requirements
============
We currently support SmartOS only, but it should be easy to add support for other systems.  Also requires the ModCloth git and smartos cookbooks.

Attributes
==========
We set an attribute to lock the listening daemon to private interfaces only.
